## Future Features Ideas:

-- Extract features such as word embeddings, sentiment scores, and keyword frequencies.
Consider context-aware features using models like BERT or GPT.


-- Track user behavior over time to identify patterns indicative of problematic behavior.

-- Implement a more dynamic threshold based on the severity of the detected issue.
        Example: Minor infractions could have a higher threshold than major infractions.

-- Implement logging and monitoring to track the performance of your moderation system in real-time.
-- Use tools like Grafana or Kibana for visualization.
